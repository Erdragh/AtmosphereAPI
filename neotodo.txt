TODO in NeoForge:
Special handler for reading dimension datamaps:
- Vanilla dimensions only get added to the registry access on world creation, but datamaps are loaded on opening the create world screen
- Skip datamaps on `minecraft:dimension` until dimensions are fully loaded:
  Places where this happens
  - CreateWorldScreen, multiple places. Probably at least on fresh creation and from world
  - Possibly others
